dictmaster

Start downloading and converting with:

    ./dictmaster.py PLUGIN_NAME
    
You find available plugins in the `plugins` directory.

You dictionary data will be saved in `data/PLUGIN_NAME/stardict.*` in
stardict format.
(Note that for some dictionaries the directory `data/PLUGIN_NAME/res` is also
needed.)
