words.txt
---------

The list of words contained in the DRAE according to the project on
https://code.google.com/p/tokland/wiki/DiccionarioRAE.

Note that the downloader presented there is from 2012 and doesn't work anymore.

drae.txt
--------

According to http://www.rae.es/sites/default/files/Preambulo.pdf, the DRAE
(22th edition) contains 88,431 (23rd ed: 93,111) entries.

The file `words.txt` contains 87,603 words and hence seems to be a good
approximation. But when I tried to fetch these 87,603 words, for about 8,000
words the download failed. The file `drae.txt` contains roughly those 80,000
words from `words.txt` and `grandic.txt` for which the download did not fail.
