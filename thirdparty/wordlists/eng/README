ahdict.txt
----------

According to the paperback version of the 5th edition, the American Heritage
Dictionary contains "more than 70000 entries".

I tried fetching all the words in UKACD17.txt from the ahdictionary.com page.
For half of the words the download failed and in some cases, different words
yielded the same dictionary entry. The file `ahdict.txt` contains
roughly the words for which the download did not fail, and that's 62800.
