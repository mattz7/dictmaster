ahdict.txt
----------

According to the paperback version of the 5th edition, the American Heritage
Dictionary contains "more than 70,000 entries".

I tried fetching all the words in UKACD17, ENABLE, EOWL, and GCIDE from the
ahdictionary.com page (that's more than 330,000!). AH is not really the most
comprehensive dictionary ("only" 70,000 entries), so there are no entries for
exotic terms (such as iconomy, phototropy, naik), certain names (such as Naja,
McEwan, Lynam) or phrases (such as "Lyon King of Arms", "a barking dog never
bites"). Accordingly, for 60% of the words the download failed and lots of words
would be redirected to the same entry (e.g. abolish, abolishable, abolished,
abolisher, abolishes, abolishing, abolishment).

The file `ahdict.txt` contains roughly the words for which the download did not
fail (cleaned from the terms that would redirect to the same page), and that's
more than 68,000 word. Fetching and parsing these files results in a
stardict version of the AH dictionary with almost 70,000 entries. So that's
pretty close to the original one.
